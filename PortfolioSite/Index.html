                    Unfortunately, no screenshots of the final project site (even though it was pretty sick).
                    I lost access to the databse before I could get any.
                    Our final solution had the basic functionality of adding, editing, and deleting boxes.
                    What made ours stand out was that it included filtering for any amount of parameters, sorting by each parameter while in the index, and searching by box ID.

            <p>
                For this first activity focused on learning source control, we found that source control is both an incredible tool
                that can also cause incredible problems. Eventually we got into the flow of it and everything worked at quite well.
                The biggest thing we learned from this activity was how important communicating with the team is. This helped us best
                designate features to work on, ensure there were no merge conflicts, resolve blocks, etc.
            </p>
            <h3 class="w3-text-grey">Client Side: Unit Conversion</h3>
            <p>
                Going to our first more coding intensive task, we expected most of the issues to be figuring out how to do things in javascript.
                Surprisingly, we got the hang of it really quickly and found that the hardest part was actually applying our "soft skills". Individually,
                we didn't have much problem completing our pages, but the dillema came when we found that we had poorly allocated tasks. This led to
                really awkward blocks to resolve and messy allocation near the end of the project. Though we did get it done, we learned that
                trello is an amazing tool we need to start using more, and that we should spend more time figuring out what needs to be coded
                in what order, before we just start hacking away.
            </p>
            <h3 class="w3-text-grey">Server Side: Unit Conversion</h3>
            <p>
                For this project we didn't exactly learn our lesson from the last. Though we did try and spend more time organizing and actually using
                the trello board, when time inevitably got tight we forewent organization and proper allocation for trying to code as much as possible
                as quickly as possible. The biggest takeaway again is that hard skill (good programming) isn't all that great in the absence of soft
                skills.
            </p>
            <h3 class="w3-text-grey">Final Project: Boxes</h3>
            <p>
                For the final project, everything really came together. We ran into significantly fewer issues concerning organization than
                in past projects. The trello board was setup well and tasks were prioritized so no blocks ever occurred. Communication was good
                and code issues were worked through efficiently. One thing we found extremely helpful for this final
                project as a team was pair programming. By assigning multiple people to a feature we were able to get things done more
                quickly and effectively. For example, we initially had quite a bit of trouble figuring out things like adding clickable
                column headers to sort the table. Once we added more people to the job and always had a second pair of eyes on the code
                the feature got implemented in very little time.
            </p>
            <h3 class="w3-text-grey">Overall</h3>
            <p>
                At the end of the training experience I learned a lot of valuable things I didn't expect to learn going into the "Full Stack
                Summer Camp". This was all expedited by the fact that Full Stack Development, though something initially quite foreign, was
                something quite comfortable to learn and get used to. Since difficult code wasn't the main issue I got to discover a lot about
                the soft skills that a developer needs to have. Above all else was the importance of communication. Not only to figure out bugs
                in code, but to plan out what should be prioritized and how that can be done most effectively. Though we spent more time on hard
                skills - C#, HTML, CSS, Javascript, MVC - my biggest take away is learning how to scrum.
